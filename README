= TaskTHIS =

Task*THIS* is a technology demo. It's provided as
an example of how easy an AJAX enabled application 
is to build using Rails (2.1.1)


== Requirements

* Ruby
* Rails (2.1+)
* RedCloth
* Sqlite, MySql or Postgres


== Installation

=== Database

The database uses Rails' Migration support. All you
should have to do it initialize your database, after
you created it, is to call:

 > rake db:migrate

As long as you've configured the database correctly 
in config/database.yml, it should create the schema 
for you.

=== General

You may need to set the 'executable' bit of the files 
in the script/ folder on *nix systems (including Mac 
OS X):

> chmod 0744 script/*


== Special Thanks

* Robby (www.robbyonrails.com) for the PostgreSQL 
  schema script
